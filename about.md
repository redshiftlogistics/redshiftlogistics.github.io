		Redshift Logistics was founded in 3272 and aims to disrupt Federal and Independent markets with its breaking from Empire ownership. The introduction of the Frame Shift Drive and recent investment has seen RLOG's cargo fleet overhauled with a new generation of ships capable of going head-to-head with larger competitors within the Bubble.

		Based at Dobrovolskiy Enterprise in WISE 1506+7027 for its central location to major landmarks within the bubble and close proximity to Sol. Redshift Logistics is at the centre of most major trade routes. <br>Here at Redshift, we pride ourselves on being an independent company. We are capable of tackling all areas of business regardless of superpower affiliation. <br>Within the bubble, RLOG operates a large network of full time and contracted pilots. This approach offers a rapid and hassle-free experience that ensures our contracts are delivered.</p>

		<p><i>We are an Xbox One PvE focused private player group with a squadron and player minor faction representing us in game. We incorporate elements of roleplay and are more than happy to employ commanders of all skill levels.</i></p>
