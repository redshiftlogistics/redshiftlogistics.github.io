		<p>Based at Dobrovolskiy Enterprise in WISE 1506+7027 for its central location to major landmarks within the bubble and close proximity to Sol. Redshift Logistics is at the centre of most major trade routes. <br>Here at Redshift, we pride ourselves on being an independent company. We are capable of tackling all areas of business regardless of superpower affiliation. <br>Within the bubble, RLOG operates a large network of full time and contracted pilots. This approach offers a rapid and hassle-free experience that ensures our contracts are delivered.</p>

		<p><i>We are an Xbox One PvE focused private player group with a squadron and player minor faction representing us in game. We incorporate elements of roleplay and are more than happy to employ commanders of all skill levels.</i></p>
