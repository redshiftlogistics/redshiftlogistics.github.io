## Rules

1. Racism will not be tolerated.

2. Inactivity is not a problem.

3. Joining the in-game squadron is not mandatory, just encouraged.

4. Be kind and respectful.

5. RP is not mandatory, just encouraged.

6. Respect management or get the HR Team involved.

7. Don't spam

8. Don't be aggressive towards other members.

9. Being a member of another player group (barring exceptions; Mobius or just inquire with an Officer) will require you to keep the contractor role.

10. Player killing is not tolerated, destroying a ship without reason will result in disciplinary action. Victims of griefing are encouraged to record incidents, use that share function and privately contact the HR Team.

For squadron members playing in open, abide by our rules of engagement with other players as you are representing RLOG. (Contractors are exempt from this rule when dealing with the public)

This excludes planned PvP events.

11. Try to stay on topic and use appropriate channels, eg. NSFW content must stay in #off-topic-nsfw

12. We encourage the use of the squadron channels, this especially helps when coordinating plans to manipulate BGS based faction events.

13. Use the suggestions channel or request a ticket, we can't improve without your feedback!

14. Don't unnecessarily @ people in the middle of their sleep, UTC makes it easier to tell if someone is in bed

15. Leaving this Discord server will be seen as grounds for contract termination and as such, all access to RLOG assets will be revoked.

16. Don't fly without rebuy, ever.

17. Changing your gamertag without notifying the HR Team will result in a kick or you being moved back into #screening
