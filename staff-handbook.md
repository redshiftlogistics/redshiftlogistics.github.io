## Rules

1. Racism will not be tolerated.

2. Inactivity is not a problem, there are channels for AFK members. If you need a break from Elite, use the #role-request channel to set yourself to @On Leave. You can set yourself to @Payrolled when you come back.

3. Joining the in-game squadron is not mandatory, just encouraged. A @Contractor [0] is always welcomed.

4. Be kind.

5. RP is not mandatory, just encouraged.

6. Respect the senior ranks, but don't be afraid to speak up. We can always get a Moderator from HR involved.

7. Don't spam

8. Don't be aggressive towards other members.

9. Being a member of another player group (barring exceptions; Mobius or just inquire with an Officer) will require you to take the contractor role.

10. Friendly fire is not tolerated, destroying another members ship will result in disciplinary action. Victims of griefing are encouraged to record incidents, use that share function and privately contact a Moderator. This excludes planned PvP events.

11. Try to stay on topic and use appropriate channels, eg. NSFW content must stay in #random

12. We encourage the use of the squadron channels, this especially helps when coordinating plans to manipulate BGS based faction events.

13. Use the #suggestions channel, we can't improve without your feedback!

14. Don't unnecessarily @ individuals and don't use @everyone/@here, UTC makes it easier to tell if someone is in bed
