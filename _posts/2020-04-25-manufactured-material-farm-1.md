Dav's Hope is an abandoned planetary base that has a large amount of manufactured materials ready for scooping with an SRV. Starting at our HQ at Dobrovolskiy Enterprise, plot a course for Hyades Sector DR-V C2-23 or use our squadron bookmark "Farm: Davs Hope". This is 178.5LY from WISE 1506+7027 so it is advisable to bring a ship outfitted for exploration like a Diamondback Explorer.

Before you head off, be sure you have the following modules equipped on your ship:
- SRV
- Fuel Scoop
- Planetary Landing Suite
- Detailed Surface Scanner

Once at Hyades Sector DR-V C2-23, scan the system and begin moving towards planet A5.

If you have visited before you should be able to see a new entry on your left side navigation menu for "Davs Hope". If not then approach the planet slowly, use your detailed surface scanner to drop a probe onto the planet surface and begin your approach towards the co-ordinates 44.8180, -31.3893.

If you haven't visited before this can take a little while to locate, this should be the one and only time you will have to locate it in this way.

The closest material trader is 42.91 LY away at **Vaucanson Gateway in HIP 12067**. It's recommended to trade any common materials away at the material trader if you're going to be doing a few return trips.
