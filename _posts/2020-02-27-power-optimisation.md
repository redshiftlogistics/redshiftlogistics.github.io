Optimising your ships power output with some extra priority configuration seems daunting at first, but here's a template for your power output needs. This configuration is for a general purpose combat multirole ships which can be tweaked to suit your needs. Smuggling ships for instance, will want a different setup entirely.

Modules with the lower number are a higher priority whereas modules with a higher number are of a lower priority. This means that if you begin using weapon modules when you deploy your hardpoints, modules of a lower priority will shutdown to save power. Who needs a docking computer mid combat right?

| Module/Type | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thrusters | 1 | |
| FSD | 1 | |
| Life Support | 2 | |
| Sensors | 2 | |
| Shields | 3 | |
| Shield Boosters | 3 | |
| Weapons | 4 | |
| Defense Utilities | 5 | Chaff, KWS, ECM, Heat Sinks, Shield Cell Banks etc. |
| Other Utilities | 5 | FSD Booster, FSD Interdictor, Fuel Scoop etc.
| Flight Assists | 5 | Docking Computer, Supercruise Assist | |
| Cargo | 5 | Cargo Hatch, Limpet Controllers |

If your powerplant malfunctions or is put offline (0% integrity) then your total power output will be reduced to 40%; meaning your priority 1 modules should max out out 39%, any higher and **everything** on your ship will be disabled. Thrusters and FSD are the only things that need to be in priority 1. Other modules can be set priority 1 if you have enough power for it, otherwise those modules should go to priority 2. On CMDR Tenacious C's recommendation, shields & boosters in priority 3, weapons in priority 4 and non essentials in priority 5.
