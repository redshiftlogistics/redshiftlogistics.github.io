Optimising your ships power output with some extra priority configuration seems daunting at first, but here's a basic template for your power output needs. This configuration is specifically for a general purpose combat multirole ship. Smuggling ships for instance, will want a different setup entirely.

| Module/Type | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thrusters | 1 | |
| Shields | 1 | |
| Life Support | 1 | |
| Sensors | 1 | |
| Shield Utilites | 2 | Shield Boosters, Shield Cell Banks |
| Weapons | 3 | |
| Offensive/Defensive Utilities | 4 | chaff, KWS, heat sinks, etc. |
| FSD | 5 | FSD, FSD Booster, FSD Interdictor, Fuel Scoop | |
| Flight Assists | 5 | Docking Computer, Supercruise Assist | |
| Cargo | 5 | Cargo Hatch, Limpet Controllers |

Modules with the lower number are a higher priority whereas modules with a higher number are of a lower priority. This means that if you begin using weapon modules when you deploy your hardpoints, modules of a lower priority will shutdown to save power. Who needs a docking computer mid combat right?
